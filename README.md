# Entity-Framework-Core-using-Code-First-Approach
Entity Framework Core is new version of Entity Framework after EF 6.x.It is open-source, lightweight, and a cross-platform version of Entity Framework data access technology.EF Core is intended to be used with .NET Core applications.However, it can also be used with standard .NET 4.5+ framework based applications.
The Code-First approach in Entity Framework (EF) allows developers to focus on writing C# classes (which define the application's domain model) before worrying about the underlying database.Entity Framework automatically generates the database schema based on the classes and relationships defined in the code. This approach contrasts with Database-First, where you start with an existing database, or Model-First, where you design the model using a visual designer.
